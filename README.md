# Portfolio-Game

Welcome to my portfolio game!

This innovative project involved the craft of utilizing TypeScript, React JS, and Material UI to bring the game engine to life. To streamline content management, I integrated Sanity, a headless CMS, seamlessly with GraphQL, ensuring a cohesive and efficient development process.

I also use a little bit Three.js to create a 3d model in the front page.
